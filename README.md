## Abstract : 

<p align="justify"> Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural country where agriculture is vital in accelerating economic
growth. The population is rapidly expanding, and with this growth, the demand for food is also increasing.
Farmers must use toxic pesticides more frequently and intensively on the soil to meet the growing demand
because traditional methods are insufficient. Moreover, this practice can occasionally result in crop failure,
wasting a lot of crops, money, and labor. To meet the demands, new automated technologies known as AI
were established which brought about an agricultural revolution, with the use of this method all of our
traditional problems can be handled in the blink of an eye. Our DIGITAL KIRISHI is an AI-based
comprehensive solution where we are using machine learning techniques to predict crop yields, detect
disease in crops, and optimize irrigation and fertilization. Since other existing solutions allude to pricey
IOT-based support and systems that are fully automated for which our farmers may lose their jobs, farmers
in our system can do their jobs precisely without the worry of losing them. </p>
